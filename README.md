Epistasis Detection is a bioinformatics application which refers to the discovery of correlations between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and an observed phenotype (e.g., a disease). Finding new SNP associations has a high impact on precision medicine, contributing to improve personalized healthcare. The optimal strategy for epistasis detection is to evaluate all possible SNP combination, but this incurs in a high computational cost (e.g., on a dataset with 500 000 SNPs, evaluating 2-SNP associations would amount to analyze 125 billion combinations). Herein, a transformer neural network is implemented for high order epistasis detection by means of interpretation metrics (e.g., attention scores) that allow to identify SNPs that may be relevant to the observed phenotype.
